Styling: CSS is autogenerated from SCSS. You must have SASS, Compass, Autoprefixer, and the Zurb Foundation gem installed. Edit in the scss directory; CSS will output into the css directory.
*
* 
Much of the Wordpress template codebase comes from underscores.me. I've put in a few extra things I
have created and used in the past. There is a functions TOC in functions.php (much of the actual functions
are in the inc/ directory).

If you're changing one of my client sites, please feel free to get in touch with me for assistance
with this theme if you need anything. I won't be offended and would love to meet you.
